handling errors
---------------

we can add a error.js file like we have layout.js page.js in the app folder..this error page handles the error which happens in our component and pages

wwe can render a error component which will be shown when the error occured.. we can create this error.js in hte root folder as well which handles all pages error..also we can use this for specific pages as well this is upto us..

we can also destructure the error object which next js gives
export default function Error({error}){ {

 this componet must be a  client componet

'use client';

export default function Error() {
  return (
    <main className="error">
      <h1>An error occurred!</h1>
      <p>Failed to fetch meal data. Please try again later.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
